---------------When we use PERCENTAGE width V/S FIXED width----------------:

1. Then while the screen is reduced to responsive screen (if
used fixed width) the width of the design doesn't seem responsive.


2. The by deafault width of the block level elements is 100% the screen
size.

3. The parent element is 100% of the viewport, so when you set parent 
element as 80% then it becomes 80% of the screen (viewport) 



----------------PERCENTAGE used in the CHILD element--------------------

1. When fixed width is used inside of the child element then overflow 
happens i.e., it doesn't become responsive.


2. In order to avoid that issue percentage must be used. Basically, inorder
to avoid unresponsiveness of the website one must always prefer using 
percentage to define the width or the height.
