----------------------------AVOIDING HEIGHTS------------------------------

1. If you are having issues related to heights, then simply don't use the
height. Naturally, our website is responsive so does the height will be
responsive too. 


2. If you want some space without adding height then use PADDING.


3. Similar to percentage, em and rem are both responsive.


**************** EM AND REM 

1. em depends upon its parent for its font-size, and rem depends upon its
root for the font-size. The default font size is 16px.


2. the other properties for em unit except font-size depends upon the 
size of the font of the element it is under, but not the parent element.
