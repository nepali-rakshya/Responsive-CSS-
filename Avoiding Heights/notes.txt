----------------------------AVOIDING HEIGHTS------------------------------

1. If you are having issues related to heights, then simply don't use the
height. Naturally, our website is responsive so does the height will be
responsive too. 


2. If you want some space without adding height then use PADDING.


3. Similar to percentage, em and rem are both responsive.
